# REVOLVE

REVOLVE is a web platform that allows the production of renewable energy to be matched with the demand for energy, encouraging producers to adapt to demand. For this, a reward system called REVOLVE Tokens is offered. The same platform allows the company to monitor the status of production and adjust the demands of producers.

You can access the mock up [here](https://miquelsarrias.github.io/revolve/).
